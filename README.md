# Self-Improving Frontier Agents (SIFA) Prototype

Prototype implementation of key components from the paper "Self-Improving Frontier Agents for Insurance Operations: A Governed Architecture for Autonomous Claims Reasoning and Workflow Adaptation".

Demonstrates:

- Governed inference loop with retrieval augmentation

- Structured feedback capture

- Pattern mining using embedding clustering (HDBSCAN)

- Constrained synthetic data generation

## Execution Steps

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher

- API key for a frontier model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, or equivalent)

### Installation

```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sifa-prototype-insurance-agents.git

cd sifa-prototype-insurance-agents

pip install -r requirements.txt
